    "As you ponder the solitude of space and the ever-increasing three-hour roundtrip for messages between you and Earth, you notice that the Space Mail Indicator Light is blinking. To help keep you sane, the Elves have sent you a care package.\n",

    "It's a new game for the ship's arcade cabinet! Unfortunately, the arcade is **all the way** on the other end of the ship. Surely, it won't be hard to build your own - the care package even comes with schematics.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arcade cabinet runs Intcode software like the game the Elves sent (your puzzle input). It has a primitive screen capable of drawing square **tiles** on a grid. The software draws tiles to the screen with output instructions: every three output instructions specify the `x` position (distance from the left), `y` position (distance from the top), and `tile id`. The `tile id` is interpreted as follows:\n",
    "- `0` is an **empty** tile. No game object appears in this tile.\n",
    "- `1` is a **wall** tile. Walls are indestructible barriers.\n",
    "- `2` is a **block** tile. Blocks can be broken by the ball.\n",
    "- `3` is a **horizontal paddle** tile. The paddle is indestructible.\n",
    "- `4` is a **ball** tile. The ball moves diagonally and bounces off objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, a sequence of output values like `1,2,3,6,5,4` would draw a **horizontal paddle** tile (`1` tile from the left and `2` tiles from the top) and a **ball** tile (`6` tiles from the left and `5` tiles from the top).\n",
