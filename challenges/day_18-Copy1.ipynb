    "\n",
    "As you approach Neptune, a planetary security system detects you and activates \n",
    "a giant tractor beam on Triton! You have no choice but to land.\n",
    "\n",
    "A scan of the local area reveals only one interesting feature: a massive \n",
    "underground vault. You generate a map of the tunnels (your puzzle input). The \n",
    "tunnels are too narrow to move diagonally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only one **entrance** (marked `@`) is present among the **open passages** \n",
    "(marked `.`) and stone walls (#), but you also detect an assortment of \n",
    "**keys** (shown as lowercase letters) and **doors** (shown as uppercase \n",
    "letters). Keys of a given letter open the door of the same letter: `a` opens \n",
    "`A`, `b` opens `B`, and so on. You aren't sure which key you need to disable \n",
    "the tractor beam, so you'll need to **collect all of them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose you have the following map:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#########\n",
    "#b.A.@.a#\n",
    "#########\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Starting from the entrance (`@`), you can only access a large door (`A`) and \n",
    "a key (`a`). Moving toward the door doesn't help you, but you can move `2` steps \n",
    "to collect the key, unlocking `A` in the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "#########\n",
    "#b.....@#\n",
    "#########\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, you can move `6` steps to collect the only other key, `b`:\n",

    "```\n",
    "#########\n",
    "#@......#\n",
    "#########\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, collecting every key took a total of **`8`** steps.\n",
