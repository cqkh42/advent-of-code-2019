    "You fly into the asteroid belt and reach the Ceres monitoring station. The Elves here have an emergency: they're having trouble tracking all of the asteroids and can't be sure they're safe.\n",

    "The Elves would like to build a new monitoring station in a nearby area of space; they hand you a map of all of the asteroids in that region (your puzzle input).\n",
    "\n",
    "The map indicates whether each position is empty (`.`) or contains an asteroid (`#`). The asteroids are much smaller than they appear on the map, and every asteroid is exactly in the center of its marked position. The asteroids can be described with `X,Y` coordinates where `X` is the distance from the left edge and `Y` is the distance from the top edge (so the top-left corner is `0,0` and the position immediately to its right is `1,0`).\n",

A monitoring station can **detect** any asteroid to which it has **direct line of sight** - that is, there cannot be another asteroid **exactly** between them. This line of sight can be at any angle, not just lines aligned to the grid or diagonally. The **best** location is the asteroid that can **detect** the largest number of other asteroids.\n",

(The only asteroid it cannot detect is the one at `1,0`; its view of this asteroid is blocked by the asteroid at `2,2`.)

    "\n",
    "If multiple asteroids are **exactly** in line with the station, the laser only has enough power to vaporize **one** of them before continuing its rotation. In other words, the same asteroids that can be **detected** can be vaporized, but if vaporizing one asteroid makes another one detectable, the newly-detected asteroid won't be vaporized until the laser has returned to the same position by rotating a full 360 degrees.\n",

    "```\n",
